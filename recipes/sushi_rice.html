        <li>White sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to a saucepan with water (use 3 parts water to 2 parts rice). 
            Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and cook, covered, until the rice is tender 
            and all the water has been absorbed.</li>
        <li>Combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar, and salt in a separate saucepan. Cook over medium 
            heat until the sugar has dissolved.</li>
        <li>Allow the vinegar mixture to cool, then stir it into the cooked rice. Stir until the rice is nice and sticky 
            â€” it'll look wet at first, but it'll dry as it cools.</li>
